Data Science Project | Academic

The Loan Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the eligibility of loan applicants based on key financial and personal attributes. By analyzing past data patterns, it helps banks and financial institutions make faster and data-driven loan approval decisions.

ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions:

Performed data preprocessing and cleaning using Pandas and NumPy to handle missing values and outliers in financial datasets.

Applied feature engineering to transform categorical data into model-usable format using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.

Trained and evaluated multiple ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for optimal performance.

Achieved high accuracy and precision on test data, ensuring reliable predictions on unseen loan applications.

Developed a simple Flask-based web interface to allow users to enter input values and receive prediction results.

ðŸ”¹ Impact:

Provides financial institutions with a risk assessment tool to minimize loan default.

Enhances operational efficiency and transparency in loan application evaluation.

Demonstrates the real-world application of machine learning in fintech.

This project reflects a comprehensive understanding of the machine learning pipeline, including data analysis, model training, and deployment in a user-friendly application.
